convert.f
Converts point and click data from FES surface using gnuplot terminal to bins for structures.

conv_rect.f
Converts point and click data from FES surface using gnuplot terminal to bins for structures. Don't remember the difference from convert.f, sorry.

mfe_barrier.sh
Goes through all modes and lets you click on minima and barriers to get effective barriers for each mode by hand.

mfe_pdball.sh
Script to plot FES, obtain average structure from avall_m*_theta*_phi* files at each click point on mode FES map, writes output to pdb file for all atoms in protein.

mfe_pdb.sh
Script to plot FES, obtain average structure from avall_m*_theta*_phi* files at each click point on mode FES map, writes output to pdb file for alpha-carbons of protein.

mfe.sh
Script to plot FES, plot average structures of alpha-carbons.

pdbmaker_all.f
Takes avall_m*_theta*_phi* and writes to pdb file for all protein atoms.

pdbmaker.f
Takes av_m*_theta*_phi* and writes to pdb file for alpha-carbons only.
