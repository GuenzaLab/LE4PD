# Langevin Equation for Protein Dynamics

# _DO NOT MERGE!_

This branch contains the original LE4PD fortran codes developed by __Jeremy Copperman__, and __Marina Guenza__. The codes use a coase-grained Langevin formalism to obtain site-specific dynamics of proteins. This formalism takes the structural ensemble available to the protein as input, and generates the relaxation dynamics analytically.
